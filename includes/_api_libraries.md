##Feedback SDKs for iOS and Android

Our mobile feedback SDKs let app developers:

 * Embed SurveyMonkey surveys in iOS or Android apps using a [SDK collector](http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Mobile-SDK#hash)
 * Schedule an intercept to prompt users to take a survey at a custom time interval
 * Bind to survey submissions and customize subsequent flows for a user based on their response 
 * Use [custom variables](http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/What-are-custom-variables-and-how-do-I-use-them) to record additional data in survey submissions
