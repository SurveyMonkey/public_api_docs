##Survey Responses

These endpoints let you create responses directly via the API and view responses you have collected through any [collector type](http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-to-collect-responses).

[Scopes](#scopes) to use some of these endpoints require a [paid plan](https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/?ut_source=dev_portal&amp;ut_source2=docs"). The View Response Details scope requires A GOLD plan and the Create/Modify Responses scope requires a PLATINUM plan. The View Response Details scope is required for bulk and details endpoints.
